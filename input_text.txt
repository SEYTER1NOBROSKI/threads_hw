Main arti

Thompson w
anted a pr

irst tried

created a

CPL. The o

mpson modi
fied the s
yntax to b
e less 'wo

imilar to
a simplifi

nown as SM
ALGOL.[20]
He called
the resul

escribing
it as "BCP
L semantic

ot of SMAL
GOL syntax
".[20] Lik
e BCPL, B
had a boot

as the com

akin to P

(BCPL's c

started to
improve B
, to use t

s of the m
ore-powerf

A signifi
cant addit

character

He called
this New

] Thompson
started t
o use NB t
o write th

is require

21] Throug
h to 1972,
richer ty

dded to th

d arrays o
f int and
char, and
to these t
ypes were
added poin

ability to
generate
pointers t
o other ty
pes, array
s of all t
ypes, and
types to b
e returned
from func

ays within
expressio
ns were ef
fectively
treated as
pointers.
A new com
piler was
written, a
nd the lan
guage was
renamed C.
[12] The C
compiler
and some u
